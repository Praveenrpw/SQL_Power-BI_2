The goal was to provide real-time insights into revenue, sales performance, and profitability across markets to support 
data-driven decision-making in a competitive and dynamic industry.

Tools & Technologies:
1. MySQL Workbench: For data transformation and storage.
2. Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated metrics and custom measures.
4. SQL Queries: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Visualizations & Graphs: 
For creating insightful and interactive reports.
Data Sources:
1. Sales data (transactions, revenue, sales quantity)
2. Customer data (names, types, codes)
3. Market data (regions, zones, markets)
4. Product data (types, codes, costs)
5. Transaction data (types, codes, dates)

Process Overview:
1. Data Integration:
Consolidated multiple data sources, including sales, inventory, and market data, to create a unified dataset.

2. ETL Operations:
Performed data transformation and cleaning in MySQL to ensure the dataset was structured and accurate for analysis.
Stored processed data in MySQL for seamless integration into Power BI.

3. Dashboard Development
Imported the structured data into Power BI for further refinement.
Applied additional data cleaning and transformations using Power Query in Power BI.
Designed and built multiple interactive dashboards with advanced DAX calculations to provide key insights.

Key Insights & Deliverables:
1. Revenue Analysis: Total revenue of â‚¹985M across all regions, with detailed breakdowns by markets and customers.
2. Sales Trends: Analyzed 2M sales units over time with visual representations of seasonal and year-on-year trends.
3. Profitability Metrics: Delivered insights into profit margins and contributions by market and product segments.
4. Top Performers: Identified top-performing customers and products driving significant revenue and profit.
5. Regional Trends: Highlighted underperforming markets to support targeted strategy development.

Impact
1. Empowered stakeholders with real-time insights into sales, revenue, and profitability.
2. Provided actionable data to improve decision-making and focus on growth opportunities.
